## Ayush Manu creative guardrails

These notes keep every new section or iteration of the site aligned with the in-house look and feel.

### Tone and copy
- Speak in first person (“I craft…”) when referencing Ayush and first-plural (“we”) only for collaborations.
- Emphasize bespoke storytelling, music rhythm, and cinematic pacing; avoid buzzwords about automation or AI.
- Showcase recent client wins with concrete metrics when available.

### Visual direction
- Palette: charcoal backgrounds, warm copper accents, and soft white typography.
- Typography: Favor bold condensed display faces for headings and high-legibility sans-serif for body text.
- Motion: Use easing curves that feel analog (ease-out, spring) and keep transitions under 400ms.

### Components & layout
- Keep hero sections full-bleed with layered grain textures.
- Buttons are pill-shaped, uppercase, and use solid fills by default; outlines only for secondary CTAs.
- Cards should feature vignette overlays and generous padding (min 32px) to highlight video stills.

### Content backlog
- Add a behind-the-scenes reel section with short looping clips.
- Rotate marquee testimonials quarterly to keep the page feeling current.
