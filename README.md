# Ayush Manu – Portfolio Site

This repo contains the Vite + React codebase powering Ayush Manu's video portfolio. It includes polished motion-heavy sections (hero reel, client reels, testimonials, and contact) tailored to showcase bespoke editing work built completely in-house.

## Development

```pwsh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Useful scripts

- `pnpm build` – production build via Vite
- `pnpm lint` – run Biome lint rules
- `pnpm format` – auto-format the project (writes changes)
- `pnpm format:check` – verify formatting without touching files
